## Project 3: *Forecasting Air Quality with Linear Autoregressive Models*

### üß† Motivation

Air quality monitoring is critical for environmental safety and public health. Many cities operate dense sensor networks to track pollutants such as CO, NO‚ÇÇ, and O‚ÇÉ. These measurements vary across hours, days, and seasons, and their fluctuations are influenced by human activity and weather conditions.

Modeling this data is essential for short-term forecasting, anomaly detection, and policy planning ‚Äî and it also offers an ideal introduction to **time series regression**. Unlike i.i.d. datasets, time series exhibit **temporal dependencies**, where past values directly influence future ones.

This project introduces the **supervised framing of time series forecasting**, using linear models on lag-structured features. Students will explore how **autoregressive structure**, **regularization**, and **stationarity** affect performance and interpretability.

The central idea is to convert a univariate time series into an input‚Äìtarget regression problem:

$$
\text{Given past values } [y_{t-1}, y_{t-2}, \dots, y_{t-k}], \text{ predict } y_t.
$$

### üéØ Objectives

- Construct autoregressive feature matrices from raw time series  
- Train and evaluate linear models for one-step-ahead forecasting  
- Analyze autocorrelation and choose appropriate lag depth  
- Compare regularized and unregularized regression models  
- Visualize temporal prediction quality and error patterns

### üìä Suggested Dataset

- **UCI Air Quality Dataset**: Hourly measurements of pollutants (e.g., CO, NO‚ÇÇ, O‚ÇÉ) and meteorological data from an Italian city  
- Available at the [UCI ML Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Air+Quality)

Focus on:
- A single pollutant (e.g., NO‚ÇÇ) as the target series $\{y_t\}_{t=1}^T$  
- A continuous subset of data (e.g., 30‚Äì90 days of hourly values)  
- Optional: include weather variables as exogenous covariates

### üõ†Ô∏è Suggested Models

- **Autoregressive linear regression**:

$$
y_t = \beta_1 y_{t-1} + \beta_2 y_{t-2} + \dots + \beta_k y_{t-k} + \varepsilon_t
$$

- **Ridge regression** (for high-dimensional lag settings)  
- **Naive baseline**:

$$
\hat{y}_t = y_{t-1}
$$

### ‚úÖ Minimum Requirements

- Clean and preprocess the dataset (e.g., handle missing values, normalize if needed)  
- Construct a **lagged feature matrix** $\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times k}$ and target vector $\mathbf{y} \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ using:

$$
\mathbf{X} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
y_{k} & y_{k-1} & \dots & y_{1} \\
y_{k+1} & y_{k} & \dots & y_{2} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
y_{T-1} & y_{T-2} & \dots & y_{T-k}
\end{bmatrix},
\quad
\mathbf{y} =
\begin{bmatrix}
y_{k+1} \\
y_{k+2} \\
\vdots \\
y_T
\end{bmatrix}
$$

- Train at least two models and compare using RMSE and/or MAE  
- Plot predictions vs. actual values over a test period  
- Plot autocorrelation (ACF) and partial autocorrelation (PACF) to justify choice of lag $k$

### üöÄ Optional Extensions

- Use multiple input features: past values of other pollutants or weather variables  
- Analyze how increasing lag depth $k$ affects overfitting and stability   
- Analyze performance by hour-of-day or weekday/weekend split  
- Visualize learned coefficients as functions of lag index $i$
